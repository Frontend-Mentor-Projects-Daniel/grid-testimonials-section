                  I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                  been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
                  who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                  intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                  thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
                  - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                  at a VR startup

                  I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I
                  now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one
                  of the best investments I’ve made in myself.

                  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                  themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their

                  The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
                  find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
                  necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
                  as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
                  You will get the personal attention you need from an
                  incredible community of smart and amazing people.

                  Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
                  often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                  developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend!
